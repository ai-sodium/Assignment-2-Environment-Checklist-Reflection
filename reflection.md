Setting up the Python was easy because I already have it pre-installed before starting with the course. However, I had trouble activating the virtual environment. The error stated "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system." At first I tried resolving the issue on my own. I tried ".venv\scripts\activate.ps1", ".venv\scripts\activate", and even tried different capitalizations and period placements. But in the end, I ended up asking ChatGPT for assistance. The instructions worked. It was hassle-free from there.

I find the syntax especially easy and conveniently short. It is easy to remember and type. I had no trouble remembering the functionality of each prompt. Executions are fun and efficient while learning through the assignment. Although it was a trial-and-error, it was an easy-learn. I honestly look forward to dive deep on Django and the virtual environment to be able to use it as a professional skill. I wish we can do more in class to get the general idea about Django's full functionality.
