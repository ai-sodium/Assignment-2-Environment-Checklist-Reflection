Setting up the python was easy because I already have it pre-installed before starting with the course. However, I had trouble activating the virtual environment. The error stated "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system." At first I tried resolving the issue by my own. I tried ".venv\scripts\activate.ps1", ".venv\scripts\activate", and even tried different capitalizations and period placements. But in the end I ended up asking chatGPT for assistance. The instructions worked and from there it was hassle-free.

I find the syntax especially easy and conveniently short. It is easy to remember and type. I had no trouble remembering the functionality of each prompts. Executions are fun and I felt efficient while learning through the assignment. Although it was a trial-and-error it was an easy-learn.
